      <description>Introduction The DASH-IF hosts and manages an online cataloging of identifiers for MPEG-DASH profiles, interoperability points, content protection metadata and other DASH related specific schemes. DASH-IF responsibilities include:
 hosting the online catalog on its website, listing all defined URIs along with a short descriptions of their schemes and names of their owners, providing a simple online mechanism to request the addition of new URIs and associated information, and finally managing the administration and maintenance of the online catalog.</description>

      <title>Audio Source Metadata</title>

      <guid>https://dash-industry-forum.github.io/identifiers/audio_source_metadata/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Audio source data may be used in order to provide details of the audio content source. In general, such characteristics of audio are logically independent of the compression format. In the context of DASH they are typically used in order to select a proper Adaptation Set. This section focuses on source format description.
In the context of DASH as specific source descriptor exists, namely AudioConfiguration identifies channel configuration signaling for Representations that contain an audio component.</description>

      <title>Content Protection</title>

      <guid>https://dash-industry-forum.github.io/identifiers/content_protection/</guid>
      <description>Introduction For the element ContentProtection the @schemeIdUri attribute is used to identify a content protection scheme (for details see ISO/IEC 23009-1 [1], section 5.8.4.1). This attribute provide sufficient information, possibly in conjunction with the @value and/or extension attributes and elements, such as the DRM system(s), encryption algorithm(s), and key distribution scheme(s) employed, to enable a client to determine whether it can possibly play the protected content.
For Representations based on ISO/IEC 14496-12 [6] a content protection scheme using the Protection System Specific Header Box defined in ISO/IEC 23001-7 may be identified in the ContentProtection element.</description>

      <description>Introduction Content Rating may be provided in the MPD.
Content Rating Schemes The following defines a set of URIs that identify MPD events, i.e., schemes contained in the EventStream element:
   Identifier Reference Section Comment     urn:dvb:iptv:guidance:2014 ETSI TS 103 285 clause 9.1.2.3 Where the id is either: G indicating that guidance text relating to the content is provided in the ExplanatoryText element within the ParentalGuidance element or W indicating watershed (safe harbour) content that is only suitable for presentation after the watershed.</description>

      <description>Introduction Events may be provided in the MPD or within a Representation in order to signal aperiodic information to the DASH client or to an application. Events are timed, i.e. each event starts at a specific media presentation time and typically has a duration. To classify events a proper scheme identifier identifies the application such that the DASH client can forward the event to the proper application.
Two ways of signalling events are provided, namely</description>

      <description>Functionality    Identifier Reference Section Comment     https://dashif.org/guidelines/trickmode DASH-IF IOP v3.2 clause 3.2.9 Defines a trick mode Adaptation Set. If an Adaptation Set in annotated with the EssentialProperty descriptor with URI https://dashif.org/guidelines/trickmode then the DASH client shall not select any of the contained Representations for regular playout.   https://dashif.org/guidelines/AdaptationSetSwitching DASH-IF IOP v3.2 clause 3.8 Defines signaling that switching from one Adaptation Set to another Adaptation Set may be possible in a seamless manner from a content and timeline perspective.</description>

      <description>General MPEG DASH defines formats for MPDs and segments. In addition MPEG provides the ability to further restrict the applied formats by the definition of Profiles as defined on section 8 of ISO/IEC 23009-1 [1]. Profiles of DASH are defined to enable interoperability and the signaling of the use of features. Profiles are signaled in the @profiles parameter which may be present on different levels of the MPD.
Such a profile can also be understood as permission for DASH clients that implement the features required by the profile to process the Media Presentation (MPD document and Segments).</description>

      <description>Introduction Reporting scheme may be provided in the MPD.
Reporting Schemes    Identifier Reference Section Comment     urn:dvb:dash:reporting:2014 ETSI TS 103 285 clause 10.12.3 The DVB Metric reporting mechanism defined by TS 103 285.   urn:3GPP:ns:PSS:DASH:QM10 3GPP TS 26.247 clause 10.5 This section specifies a 3GP-DASH quality reporting scheme.

      <guid>https://dash-industry-forum.github.io/identifiers/subtitle_and_closed_captioning/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Beyond regular audio and video support, TV programs typically also require support for auxiliary components such as subtitles and closed captioning, often due to regulatory requirements. DASH-IF IOP provides tools to addresses these requirements. We collect them here.
Identifiers Signalling for the closed caption services is provided by including Accessibility descriptors. The Accessibility descriptor is included for the AdaptationSet and all included Representations shall provide equivalent captions. The @value attribute of each descriptor can be either list of languages or a complete map of services (or CC channels, in CEA-608 terminology).</description>
