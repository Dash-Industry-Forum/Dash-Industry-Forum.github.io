DASH-IF Grand Challenge: Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP Challenge Description Real-time entertainment services such as streaming video and audio are currently accounting for more than 70% of the Internet traffic during peak hours. Interestingly, these services are all delivered over-the-top (OTT) of the existing networking infrastructure using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).</description>

      <description>DASH-IF has been facilitating and promoting the adoption of the MPEG-DASH standard fsince 2012 and is known by the industry as the authority on the DASH standard and its deployment. DASH-IF believes that the DASH standard enables the industry to create an open, interoperable, multi-vendor ecosystem for the internet video streaming market, and is committed to industry-wide deployment of the MPEG-DASH standard. To help further accelerate the market adoption of MPEG-DASH, some of our member companies who are major contributors to the MPEG-DASH standard have made announcements regarding access to their essential DASH patents.</description>

      <description>In April 2012, ISO, the international standards body which had already given us the core media foundations of MPEG-2, MP3 and MP4, finally ratified the version of its next generation adaptive streaming standard: MPEG-DASH. In an industry besieged by three comparable (but incompatible) segmented formats many asked – why another? The participating companies in the MPEG-DASH standardization (including Microsoft, Apple, Netflix, Qualcomm, Ericsson, Samsung, and many others) saw a vision of interoperability and convergence required for large-scale market growth that trumped the proprietary and competing solutions.</description>

      <description>The MPEG-DASH standard has raised a huge momentum within both industry and academia. The DASH-IF provides – among others – interoperability guidelines and test vectors, and closes the gap enabling interoperable deployments. In recent years, we have seen a tremendous amount of research papers addressing various issues in and around DASH, and thus, the DASH-IF established an academic track to:
 identify research communities working in the area of DASH, create awareness of DASH-IF material and promote it within the academic community, and solicit research within and collect results from the academic community.</description>

      <guid>https://dash-industry-forum.github.io/identifiers/content_protection/</guid>
      <description>Introduction For the element ContentProtection the @schemeIdUri attribute is used to identify a content protection scheme (for details see ISO/IEC 23009-1 [1], section 5.8.4.1). This attribute provide sufficient information, possibly in conjunction with the @value and/or extension attributes and elements, such as the DRM system(s), encryption algorithm(s), and key distribution scheme(s) employed, to enable a client to determine whether it can possibly play the protected content.
For Representations based on ISO/IEC 14496-12 [6] a content protection scheme using the Protection System Specific Header Box defined in ISO/IEC 23001-7 may be identified in the ContentProtection element.</description>

      <description>Introduction The DASH-IF hosts and manages an online cataloging of identifiers for MPEG-DASH profiles, interoperability points, content protection metadata and other DASH related specific schemes. DASH-IF responsibilities include:
 hosting the online catalog on its website, listing all defined URIs along with a short descriptions of their schemes and names of their owners, providing a simple online mechanism to request the addition of new URIs and associated information, and finally managing the administration and maintenance of the online catalog.</description>

      <description>General MPEG DASH defines formats for MPDs and segments. In addition MPEG provides the ability to further restrict the applied formats by the definition of Profiles as defined on section 8 of ISO/IEC 23009-1 [1]. Profiles of DASH are defined to enable interoperability and the signaling of the use of features. Profiles are signaled in the @profiles parameter which may be present on different levels of the MPD.
Such a profile can also be understood as permission for DASH clients that implement the features required by the profile to process the Media Presentation (MPD document and Segments).</description>
