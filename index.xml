      <description>Introduction The DASH-IF hosts and manages an online cataloging of identifiers for MPEG-DASH profiles, interoperability points, content protection metadata and other DASH related specific schemes. DASH-IF responsibilities include:
 hosting the online catalog on its website, listing all defined URIs along with a short descriptions of their schemes and names of their owners, providing a simple online mechanism to request the addition of new URIs and associated information, and finally managing the administration and maintenance of the online catalog.</description>

      <description>Introduction With version 5 of DASH-IF Interoperability Guidelines, DASH-IF decided to introduce different parts that each address specific aspects of DASH-based service delivery. Each part is developed and updated within its own timescale. The multipart set of documents is collectively called “DASH-IF Interoperability Points, V5.0” (IOP V5). Version 5 of the DASH-IF IOP is defined for usage with the MPEG DASH specification (ISO/IEC 23009-1) and further constrained to deliver media formatted according to the MPEG CMAF Specification (ISO/IEC 23000-19).</description>

      <description>In April 2012, ISO, the international standards body which had already given us the core media foundations of MPEG-2, MP3 and MP4, finally ratified the version of its next generation adaptive streaming standard: MPEG-DASH. In an industry besieged by three comparable (but incompatible) segmented formats many asked – why another? The participating companies in the MPEG-DASH standardization (including Microsoft, Apple, Netflix, Qualcomm, Ericsson, Samsung, and many others) saw a vision of interoperability and convergence required for large-scale market growth that trumped the proprietary and competing solutions.</description>

      <description>Available at https://conformance.dashif.org, the validator/conformance software validates DASH content (MPD and segments based on ISO-BMFF):
 The timing embedded in each representation is correct or not (segment index ‘sidx’, ‘tfdt’, …) Mandatory DASH parameters are properly encoded (SAP, fragment offsets,…). Cross-representation checks (Segment/subsegment alignment, bitstream switching). Whether there are missing segments.  The validation software was recently updated to allow validation against DASH IF, DVB, HbbTV and CMAF profiles.</description>

      <description>Introduction In early 2020, when the pandemic just was kicking off, DASH-IF replaced its f2f meetings with a series of Special Sessions. This was setup in order to provide a platform for DASH-IF members and external companies to present new ideas. DASH-IF typically invites colleagues from other organizations such as MPEG, 3GPP, DVB, SCTE, CTA WAVE or ATSC. This makes these presentations lively and interesting and we have identified relevant new topics for which some of them have been moved into work streams.</description>

      <description>The MPEG-DASH standard has raised a huge momentum within both industry and academia. The DASH-IF provides – among others – interoperability guidelines and test vectors, and closes the gap enabling interoperable deployments. In recent years, we have seen a tremendous amount of research papers addressing various issues in and around DASH, and thus, the DASH-IF established an academic track to:
 identify research communities working in the area of DASH, create awareness of DASH-IF material and promote it within the academic community, and solicit research within and collect results from the academic community.</description>

With 18 months of collaborative work, the DASH-IF published a technical specification on live media ingest. While DASH is excellent for streaming to clients, transmitting content from a live source to an origin or packager benefits from a different approach. The live media ingest specification provides this and defines a protocol to ingest DASH and CMAF content using the HTTP POST method.</description>

      <description>Introduction Audio source data may be used in order to provide details of the audio content source. In general, such characteristics of audio are logically independent of the compression format. In the context of DASH they are typically used in order to select a proper Adaptation Set. This section focuses on source format description.
In the context of DASH as specific source descriptor exists, namely AudioConfiguration identifies channel configuration signaling for Representations that contain an audio component.</description>

Events are timed, i.e. each event starts at a specific media presentation time and typically has a duration. To classify events a proper scheme identifier identifies the application such that the DASH client can forward the event to the proper application.

      <description>Introduction Output protection schemes, such as HDCP are frequently used to protect the rendered output in transit from the decoding device to the displaying device (for example, from a set-top box which is connected to a TV set using an HDMI cable). These output protection schemes and their properties are frequently a pre-requisite for the ability to present the associated Representations.
For the element OutputProtection the @schemeIdUri attribute is used to identify an output protection scheme (for details see ISO/IEC 23009-1 [1], section 5.</description>

      <description>General MPEG DASH defines formats for MPDs and segments. In addition MPEG provides the ability to further restrict the applied formats by the definition of Profiles as defined on section 8 of ISO/IEC 23009-1 [1]. Profiles of DASH are defined to enable interoperability and the signaling of the use of features. Profiles are signaled in the @profiles parameter which may be present on different levels of the MPD.
Such a profile can also be understood as permission for DASH clients that implement the features required by the profile to process the Media Presentation (MPD document and Segments).</description>

      <description>General MPEG DASH part 5 Server And Network-assisted DASH defines messages and MPD signalling for a DASH client and a DANE (network entity) to exchange such SAND messages.
Test vectors for SAND MPDs and messages can be fond at Test Vectors.
The following are the identifiers defined in several specification related to SAND.

      <description>Introduction Beyond regular audio and video support, TV programs typically also require support for auxiliary components such as subtitles and closed captioning, often due to regulatory requirements. DASH-IF IOP provides tools to addresses these requirements. We collect them here.
Identifiers Signalling for the closed caption services is provided by including Accessibility descriptors. The Accessibility descriptor is included for the AdaptationSet and all included Representations shall provide equivalent captions. The @value attribute of each descriptor can be either list of languages or a complete map of services (or CC channels, in CEA-608 terminology).</description>

      <description>Introduction Video source data may be used in order to provide details of the video content source. In general, such characteristics of video are logically independent of the compression format. In the context of DASH they are typically used in order to select a proper Adaptation Set. This section focuses on source format description.
In the context of DASH as specific source descriptor exists, namely FramePacking used to identify the frame-packing configuration scheme employed.</description>
