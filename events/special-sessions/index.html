  <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>In early 2020, when the pandemic just was kicking off, DASH-IF replaced its f2f meetings with a series of Special Sessions. This was setup in order to provide a platform for DASH-IF members and external companies to present new ideas. DASH-IF typically invites colleagues from other organizations such as MPEG, 3GPP, DVB, SCTE, CTA WAVE or ATSC. This makes these presentations lively and interesting and we have identified relevant new topics for which some of them have been moved into work streams. If you are interested to give a presentation as well, please contact us.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="abstract">Abstract:</h3>
<p>This talk is an introduction to Media over QUIC (MoQ). We’ll examine why a new protocol is needed to leverage the benefits of QUIC, what is motivating the switch to pub/sub, the architectural layering of MoQ Transport and Streaming Formats, and a brief look at catalogs and the MoQT Object model.  We’ll conclude with demonstrations of MoQ implementations and a view into the current development schedule.</p>
<h3 id="participants">Participants:</h3>
<p>Experts from different organizations such as DASH-IF, DVB TM-STREAM, ATSC TG3-6, 3GPP SA4 MBS, CTA WAVE TWG, 5G-MAG RT &amp; CD-T were invited to the meeting. Over more than 100 people participated. Thank you!</p>

<h3 id="abstract-1">Abstract:</h3>
<p>The DASH-IF Live Simulator (livesim) is a mature tool focused on providing configurable live streams to test timing, MPD variants, multiple periods, and a lot of other features. Its sources are DASH VoD assets from which “live” segments are generated on request to simulate a wall-clock synchronized looped source. It has been extended to produce low-latency DASH, but is hard to extend further, and is thereby limited in what content it can use. It can, for example, not output 29.97frames/s or segment durations which are not integral seconds in average. DASH-IF is running a public test server on AWS, but the traffic costs have been quite high. The current livesim has been instrumental for both implementing and testing timing live stream timings for both dash.js and other players, and some streams from the public DASH-IF site are included in the standard test suite. Livesim2 is a new implementation, written from scratch in Go. It is much easier to deploy and can handle much more content.  A configurable traffic limiter that can limit traffic per IP-address/24h should provide useful to reduce traffic costs for a public server. The livesim2 GitHub repo will be become a public GitHub repo before the meeting. With livesim2 being a new project, it lacks many features compared to livesim, but also makes it possible to implement new scenarios and test cases. At this event, we will demonstrate livesim2 but also start the discussion about what features to prioritize and implement, and the possibility for financial sponsoring to make this possible.</p>
<p>dash.js is a free, open-source MPEG-DASH player by the Dash Industry Forum (DASH-IF). dash.js serves as a reference client for DASH-IF and various other organizations to test and verify features related to DASH based media streaming. Moreover, dash.js is a prominent option for a production grade player and widely used in the academic field. In this presentation, we dive into dash.js development and the main features of the player. We focus on recent additions such as Common Media Client Data (CMCD), Common Media Server Data (CMSD), Content Steering, and segment preloading to enable broadcast-broadband ad-insertion on HbbTV terminals. Moreover, we discuss upcoming additions to dash.js and how to contribute to the project.</p>

<h2 id="october-21-2022-ad-slot-signalling-in-dash-according-to-dvb-and-scte">October 21, 2022: Ad slot signalling in DASH according to DVB and SCTE</h2>

<li>Presenter: Presenters: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rufael-mekuria-652b4828/">Rufael Mekuria</a> (Unified Streaming), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yasser-syed-734198/">Yasser Syed</a> (Comcast)</li>
<li>Abstract: Signalling of ad slots in DASH is a feature that is increasingly popular. SCTE-35 was popular n MPEG-2 TS based workflows and is increasingly used in DASH and HLS streaming to enable ad insertion and substitution. Signalling ad breaks consistently between MPEG-2 TS and streaming workflows, and for server and client side ad insertion are key to harmonize workflows and increase interoperability. To this extent, DVB developed DVB-TA suite, including a recommendation for signalling ad slots in MPEG-2 TS and  DVB-DASH, while SCTE has updated specifications of SCTE 214 and SCTE 35 to better account for usage in streaming environments. We detail some of the problems addressed in using SCTE-35 ad slot signalling in DASH in a consistent and optimized manner for different use cases, and detail some of the timing relationships between the SCTE-35 payload and the DASH signalling and the use of single vs multi period.  Last we also present some example streams available, and some of the open topics remaining in this space.</li>

<ul>
<li>Slides</li>
<li>Abstract: The presentation will introduce on new standards and workflows for SCTE 35, 224 and more.  We will discuss how SCTE has upgraded workflows to address modern content replacement in new media.  We will provide insight on how SCTE is addressing targeted content replacement within an OTT and or broadband distribution network.  The presentation should also help to explore how this new approach might be used in different application-based environments to create a “broadcast” quality experience for ad insertion and content replacement.</li>
<li>Speaker Bio: Gary Hughes has been a long-time member of and contributor to the SCTE’s Digital Video Subcommittee.  He is particularly active in Working Group 5 which is focused on Digital Program Insertion.  He also participates in working groups focused on Advanced Coding Technologies and MPEG-DASH, among others.  An independent consultant, media technologist, and innovator, Gary is experienced in digital media delivery, broadband IPTV, video on demand, HDTV, compression and transcoding, editing and stream manipulation.  In addition to his work with SCTE, he has participated in various standards organizations and industry groups such as DASHIF, IAB, DLNA and MPEG.

<li>Presenter: Ali C. Begen et al.</li>
<li>Abstract:  In September 2020, the Consumer Technology Association (CTA) published the CTA-5004: Common Media Client Data (CMCD) specification. Using this specification, a media client can convey certain information to the content delivery network servers with object requests. This information is useful in log association/analysis, quality of service/experience monitoring and delivery enhancements. This paper is the first step toward investigating the feasibility of CMCD in addressing one of the most common problems in the streaming domain: efficient use of shared bandwidth by multiple clients. To that effect, we implemented CMCD functions on an HTTP server and built a proof-of-concept system with CMCD-aware dash.js clients.We show that even a basic bandwidth allocation scheme enabled by CMCD reduces rebuffering rate and duration without noticeably sacrifycing the video quality.</li>

<li>Abstract: ISO/IEC 23094-2 – Low Complexity Enhancement Video Coding (LCEVC) is in the final development stages in ISO. LCEVC is fundamentally different to other compression standards by virtue of being a complement to all video codecs, existing and forthcoming. This presentation will provide an overview of the principles of LC-EVC as well as two aspects related to DASH-IF efforts
Usage for Adaptive Streaming: Independent evaluation of the effectiveness of applying LCEVC enhancement in adaptive streaming use cases from a forthcoming report conducted by Streaming Media’s analyst Jan Ozer show improved QoE, compatibility with DASH and HLS as well as reduced costs due to CDN optimization

<li>Abstract: WebRTC is the foundational technology for real-time streaming online and as such has widespread support across browsers. It is used widely across many applications.  However, the use of real-time streaming for professionally-produced content is highlighting gaps in WebRTC, creating the need for industry collaboration.  This talk will explore some of these key areas and sketch out possible ways forward for the industry.</li>
