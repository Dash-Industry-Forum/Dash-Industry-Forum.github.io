# DASH IF Workshop on Media Streaming Meets 5G

Public Workshop co-sponsored by DASH-IF

Dec 9-10, 2019 - Portland, OR, USA

# MISSION AND GOAL
Along with its 22nd face to face meeting on December 10-12 in Portland, OR, the DASH Industry Forum (DASH-IF) will use this opportunity to organize a workshop in order to gather experts from video distribution services, mobile operators and technology providers.
With first 5G deployments kicking off, this is an opportunity to understand some of the technical and non-technical challenges and opportunities for mobile video services. Such information gathering allows companies and standardization organizations to focus on relevant enablers in order to create revenue-generating and interoperable video services, anticipating that video already is and will be to an increasing degree the majority of the traffic in mobile networks. Experts from different fields will discussed during two days on new opportunities and challenges. 
The goal of the workshop is to identify the challenges and possible gaps for fully taking advantage of 5G networks for multimedia streaming and related applications.
