# Introduction

The DASH-IF hosts and manages an online cataloging of identifiers for MPEG-DASH
profiles, interoperability points, content protection metadata and other DASH
related specific schemes. DASH-IF responsibilities include:

  1. hosting the online catalog on its website, listing all defined URIs along
     with a short descriptions of their schemes and names of their owners,
  2. providing a simple online mechanism to request the addition of new URIs
     and associated information, and finally
  3. managing the administration and maintenance of the online catalog.

It is believed that maintaining such a proper online catalog helps the industry
to increase the interoperability between various industry and consortia
specifications, which are utilizing the MPEG-DASH standard.

This website provides procedures how to request cataloging the identifier in
the DASH Identifier Repository and it defines a set of available descriptors
and schemes identifiers.

In order to exploit synergies, individuals and organizations are encouraged to
check the catalogue here prior to defining new identifiers. The DASH-IF will
do its best to support individuals and organizations in this matter.
