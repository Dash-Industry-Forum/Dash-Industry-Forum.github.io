# Introduction

Output protection schemes, such as HDCP are frequently used to protect the rendered output in transit from the decoding device to the displaying device (for example, from a set-top box which is connected to a TV set using an HDMI cable). These output protection schemes and their properties are frequently a pre-requisite for the ability to present the associated Representations.

For the element **`OutputProtection`** the `@schemeIdUri` attribute is used to identify an output protection scheme (for details see ISO/IEC 23009-1 \[[1](/identifiers/references#23009-1)\], section 5.8.4.X). 

The following sections collect the Output Protection schemes.
