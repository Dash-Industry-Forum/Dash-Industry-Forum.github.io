# Introduction
In early 2020, when the pandemic just was kicking off, DASH-IF replaced its f2f meetings with a series of Special Sessions. This was setup in order to provide a platform for DASH-IF members and external companies to present new ideas. DASH-IF typically invites colleagues from other organizations such as MPEG, 3GPP, DVB, SCTE, CTA WAVE or ATSC. This makes these presentations lively and interesting and we have identified relevant new topics for which some of them have been moved into work streams. If you are interested to give a presentation as well, please contact us.

# Special Sessions 2024

## December 13, 2024: SVTA DASH-IF Special Session: The Coded Multisource Media Format (CMMF) – An Introduction to Applications & Performance

### Logistics: 
- Date: December 13, 16:30 CET, 7:30 PST (about 1 hour)
- [Zoom Registration](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZwvceuprjwuHNGGQmYkwpqdc5zwvurVIogl#/registration)

### Presenters: 
- [Jeffrey Riedmiller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffrey-riedmiller/), [Jason Cloud](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasonmcloud/), [Freddie Sanchez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/freddie-sanchez-b873b9119/), [Frederic Gabin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fredericgabin/), [Christian Wolff](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christian-wolff-341471/) (Dolby Laboratories) 
- [Thomas Stockhammer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stockhammer/) (Qualcomm)


### Abstract: 
Networks are highly dynamic (non-deterministic) systems designed to operate on a best-effort basis, and traffic from several unique applications often compete for the same and finite set of resources leaving latency sensitive media applications at higher risk of reduced QoS/E in the form of rebuffering/stalls, playback failures, etc.  The performance demands next-generation media will place on network/cloud resource availability and reliability requires new thinking beyond operating over today’s underlying network infrastructure and protocols only.
Over the past few years, Dolby, and Qualcomm with support from Ateme and Orange Networks have collaborated on the development and standardization of a new interchange format for multisource coded media.  The Coded Multisource Media Format (CMMF) works seamlessly with underlying network/cloud infrastructure and protocols – and opens new operating and performance capabilities by enabling efficient distribution of media from a plurality of network sources to provide often sought after improvements in throughput, lower latency, along with significantly higher reliability without the burden of scheduling complexities or reliance on latent network/CDN performance data required for client-side orchestration.
This special session will discuss the motivation and details behind the development of CMMF ([ETSI TS 103 973](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_ts/103900_103999/103973/01.01.01_60/ts_103973v010101p.pdf)) including real-world performance findings from OTT service trials deployed worldwide.


### Participants: 
Experts from different organizations such as DASH Industry Forum, DVB Project, 3GPP SA4, Consumer Technology Association WAVE, 5G-MAG MEDIA ACTION GROUP, ATSC, SVTA, ETSI JTC Broadcast and MPEG will participate in the meeting. The meeting is open to public.

### Recording, Slides and other Material:

## October 25, 2024: DASH-IF Special Session: WAVE Streaming Media Test Suite – Devices

### Logistics: 
- Date: October 25, 16:30 CEST, 7:30 PDT
- Zoom is closed

### Presenters: 
- [Louay Bassbouss](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andyparsons/), Fraunhofer Fokus
- [Jon Piesing](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jon-piesing-98a5421/), TP Vision

### Abstract: 
The WAVE Streaming Media Test Suite for Devices enables more detailed testing of web-based media playback on devices such as Smart TVs, cell phones, media sticks and tablets.
WAVE hopes to reduce the combinatorial explosion of repetitive and overlapping testing between content or application providers and media device implementers. Ideally, device implementers could deliver evidence of passing these tests to multiple content or application providers who would, in turn, reduce the amount of 1:1 testing they require. The WAVE Streaming Media Test Suite – Devices is a set of unit tests for media presentation using MPEG CMAF media formats and the W3C Web technologies for streaming media, the “Media Source Extensions” and “Encrypted Media Extensions”. Each individual test contains HTML, JavaScript and CMAF-compatible test content. The test suite also includes a test runner based on that in the open source ‘web platform tests’ project but packaged to be easier to install and run for a broader user group. The highly automated test suite generates a test report based on recorded test runs and offline analysis.
The first tests focus on the very widely-used AVC video codec and have been extensively validated, particularly on a wide range of Smart TVs at the interoperability events organized by the HbbTV Association. Also included are less validated (“beta”) tests including ones for audio codecs from MPEG and Dolby.

### Participants: 
Experts from different organizations such as DASH Industry Forum, DVB Project, 3GPP SA4, Consumer Technology Association WAVE, 5G-MAG MEDIA ACTION GROUP, ATSC, SVTA and MPEG participated in the meeting. THe meeting is open to public.

## March 10, 2023: DASH-IF Open Source and Reference Tools - Breaking News on Live-Sim and dash.js

### Presenters: 
- [Torbjörn Einarsson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/torbjorneinarsson/) (Eyevinn)
- [Daniel Silhavy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-silhavy-21650a129/) (Fraunhofer Fokus)

### Abstract: 
The DASH-IF Live Simulator (livesim) is a mature tool focused on providing configurable live streams to test timing, MPD variants, multiple periods, and a lot of other features. Its sources are DASH VoD assets from which “live” segments are generated on request to simulate a wall-clock synchronized looped source. It has been extended to produce low-latency DASH, but is hard to extend further, and is thereby limited in what content it can use. It can, for example, not output 29.97frames/s or segment durations which are not integral seconds in average. DASH-IF is running a public test server on AWS, but the traffic costs have been quite high. The current livesim has been instrumental for both implementing and testing timing live stream timings for both dash.js and other players, and some streams from the public DASH-IF site are included in the standard test suite. Livesim2 is a new implementation, written from scratch in Go. It is much easier to deploy and can handle much more content.  A configurable traffic limiter that can limit traffic per IP-address/24h should provide useful to reduce traffic costs for a public server. The livesim2 GitHub repo will be become a public GitHub repo before the meeting. With livesim2 being a new project, it lacks many features compared to livesim, but also makes it possible to implement new scenarios and test cases. At this event, we will demonstrate livesim2 but also start the discussion about what features to prioritize and implement, and the possibility for financial sponsoring to make this possible. 
 
dash.js is a free, open-source MPEG-DASH player by the Dash Industry Forum (DASH-IF). dash.js serves as a reference client for DASH-IF and various other organizations to test and verify features related to DASH based media streaming. Moreover, dash.js is a prominent option for a production grade player and widely used in the academic field. In this presentation, we dive into dash.js development and the main features of the player. We focus on recent additions such as Common Media Client Data (CMCD), Common Media Server Data (CMSD), Content Steering, and segment preloading to enable broadcast-broadband ad-insertion on HbbTV terminals. Moreover, we discuss upcoming additions to dash.js and how to contribute to the project.


### Participants: 
Experts from different organizations such as DASH-IF, DVB TM-STREAM, ATSC TG3-6, 3GPP SA4 MBS, CTA WAVE TWG, 5G-MAG RT & CD-T are invited to the meeting.

## October 21, 2022: Ad slot signalling in DASH according to DVB and SCTE
- Presenter: Presenters: [Rufael Mekuria](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rufael-mekuria-652b4828/) (Unified Streaming), [Yasser Syed](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yasser-syed-734198/) (Comcast)
- Abstract: Signalling of ad slots in DASH is a feature that is increasingly popular. SCTE-35 was popular n MPEG-2 TS based workflows and is increasingly used in DASH and HLS streaming to enable ad insertion and substitution. Signalling ad breaks consistently between MPEG-2 TS and streaming workflows, and for server and client side ad insertion are key to harmonize workflows and increase interoperability. To this extent, DVB developed DVB-TA suite, including a recommendation for signalling ad slots in MPEG-2 TS and  DVB-DASH, while SCTE has updated specifications of SCTE 214 and SCTE 35 to better account for usage in streaming environments. We detail some of the problems addressed in using SCTE-35 ad slot signalling in DASH in a consistent and optimized manner for different use cases, and detail some of the timing relationships between the SCTE-35 payload and the DASH signalling and the use of single vs multi period.  Last we also present some example streams available, and some of the open topics remaining in this space.

## April 9, 2021

### Presentation 1: Brief Overview on CTA-5004: Common Media Client Data (CMCD)
- Slides
- Presenter: Will Law (Akamai)
- Abstract: This presentation provides a brief overview on CTA-5004: Common Media Client Data (CMCD)

## Presentation 2: Use of CMCD in HTTP Adaptive Streaming: Initial Findings
- Slides
- Presenter: Ali C. Begen et al.
- Abstract:  In September 2020, the Consumer Technology Association (CTA) published the CTA-5004: Common Media Client Data (CMCD) specification. Using this specification, a media client can convey certain information to the content delivery network servers with object requests. This information is useful in log association/analysis, quality of service/experience monitoring and delivery enhancements. This paper is the first step toward investigating the feasibility of CMCD in addressing one of the most common problems in the streaming domain: efficient use of shared bandwidth by multiple clients. To that effect, we implemented CMCD functions on an HTTP server and built a proof-of-concept system with CMCD-aware dash.js clients.We show that even a basic bandwidth allocation scheme enabled by CMCD reduces rebuffering rate and duration without noticeably sacrifycing the video quality.
