# **Introduction**

The DASH Industry Forum (DASH-IF) will have  its 11<sup>th</sup> face to face meeting on August 18-20 in San Diego and would like to use this opportunity to organize a workshop to gather together experts from video distribution services, mobile operators and technology providers.

We believe that with 5G on the horizon, this is an opportunity to understand some of the technical and non-technical challenges and opportunities for mobile video services. Such information gathering should allow companies and standardization organizations to focus on relevant enablers in order to create revenue-generating and interoperable video services, anticipating that video already is and will be to an increasing degree the majority of the traffic in mobile networks.

Experts from different fields will discuss during two days on new opportunities and challenges.

### **16:45   Content and Service Providers view on Mobile Video**

Session Chair: David Price, Ericsson, VP business development

The session will be a series of talks followed with a short Q&A and panel discussion.

Mobile video has been on the industry’s mind for decades but has had a number of notable false starts including DVB-H and MediaFLO. Now, with sights set on 5G we will finally have enough bandwidth to make video delivery ubiquitous over the next decade. Advances in codecs, content optimization and encoders will continue to help but moves to higher resolutions and richer viewing experiences will be a constant headwind. This panel will examine the likely timing and phasing of this transition and will look at what it means for service providers, content aggregators and content delivery technology.
