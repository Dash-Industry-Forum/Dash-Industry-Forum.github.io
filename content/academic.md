The MPEG-DASH standard has raised a huge momentum within both industry and academia. The DASH-IF provides – among others – interoperability guidelines and test vectors, and closes the gap enabling interoperable deployments. In recent years, we have seen a tremendous amount of research papers addressing various issues in and around DASH, and thus, the DASH-IF established an academic track to:

 * identify research communities working in the area of DASH,
 * create awareness of DASH-IF material and promote it within the academic community, and
 * solicit research within and collect results from the academic community.

## ACM MMSys 2016

The DASH-IF created the [Excellence in DASH Award](https://dashif.org/academic/excellence-in-dash-award-acm-mmsys-2016) for the first time at [ACM MMSys 2016](https://mmsys2016.itec.aau.at/excellence-in-dash-award-acm-mmsys-2016). The results were announced [here](https://mmsys2016.itec.aau.at/acm-multimedia-systems-2016-nossdav-movid-and-mmve). The award was selected by members of the DASH-IF and instead of a first, second, and third place the DASH-IF concluded to give the first price to all three papers:

* "ABMA+: lightweight and efficient algorithm for HTTP adaptive streaming” by Andrzej Beben, Piotr Wiśniewski, Jordi Mongay Batalla, Piotr Krawiec (Warsaw University of Technology, Poland)
* "Delivering Stable High-Quality Video: An SDN Architecture with DASH Assisting Network Elements” by Jan Willem Martin Kleinrouweler, Sergio Cabrero, Pablo Cesar (Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica, Netherlands)
