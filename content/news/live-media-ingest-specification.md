With 18 months of collaborative work, the DASH-IF published a technical specification on live media ingest. While DASH is excellent for streaming to clients, transmitting content from a live source to an origin or packager benefits from a different approach. The live media ingest specification provides this and defines a protocol to ingest DASH and CMAF content using the HTTP POST method. The specification can be used in streaming workflows that combine live sources, such as encoders, with recipient servers. Moreover, it enables on-the-fly manifest generation, re-packaging and re-encrypting of the received stream. The specification fits well in the DASH-IF reference streaming workflows  for ad insertion, low latency and the general DASH IOP workflows.



The specification can be accessed through our <a href="https://dashif.org/guidelines/#dash-if-technical-specification-live-media-ingest"> public website under the guidelines section</a>.

The specification was developed by the DASH IF Interoperability WG in the Live Media Ingest TF lead by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rufael-mekuria-652b4828/">Rufael Mekuria</a> (Unified Streaming).

The specification was made possible by the generous contributions and support of member companies: Akamai, CenturyLink, Microsoft, Hulu, Comcast, ITV, Qualcomm, Tencent, MediaExcel, Harmonic, Unified Streaming, Sony, Arris (CommScope), Bitmovin, DSR and AWS Elemental. And individual contributions from BBC R&D and Facebook.
