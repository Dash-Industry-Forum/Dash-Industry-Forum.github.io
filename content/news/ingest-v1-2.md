### DASH-IF publishes Live Media Ingest version 1.2

On February 28th, 2024, DASH-IF published [version 1.2 of the DASH-IF Technical Specification: Live Media Ingest](https://dashif-documents.azurewebsites.net/Ingest/master/DASH-IF-Ingest.html). Generally, the document presents the DASH-IF Live Media Ingest Protocol Specification. Two protocol interfaces are defined. The first, interface 1, CMAF ingest, is based on fragmented MPEG-4 as defined in the common media application track format (CMAF). The second interface is based on MPEG DASH and HLS as defined by ISO SC29 WG 11 and IETF. Both Interfaces use the HTTP POST Method to transmit media objects from the ingest source to the receiving entity. Examples of live streaming workflows using these protocol interfaces are also presented. The protocol interfaces also support carriage of timed metadata and timed text. Guidelines for redundancy and failover are also included.

The main updates compared to version 1.1 was the addition of Identifiers. [3GPP](https://www.3gpp.org) is using DASH-IF live media ingest protocol for contributions streaming from device to the mobile network, and for egest protocol from the mobile network to the external application service provider. To identify the use of the used protocols, the [TS 26.512](https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=3647) specification uses 3GPP URNs. Since DASH-IF protocols are generic, it it was considered  helpful if the DASH-IF ingest spec defines URI identifier(s) and then 3GPP reference them.
