# Video meets mobile -The 5G Opportunity

Public Workshop co-sponsored by DASH-IF

August 20, 2015 - San Diego, CA, United States

Along with its 11th face to face meeting on August 18-20 in San Diego, the DASH Industry Forum (DASH-IF) used this opportunity to organize a workshop in order to gather experts from video distribution services, mobile operators and technology providers.
With 5G on the horizon, this is an opportunity to understand some of the technical and non-technical challenges and opportunities for mobile video services. Such information gathering allows companies and standardization organizations to focus on relevant enablers in order to create revenue-generating and interoperable video services, anticipating that video already is and will be to an increasing degree the majority of the traffic in mobile networks. Experts from different fields will discussed during two days on new opportunities and challenges. Sponsored by:
