### DASH-IF updates Identifier submission form

DASH-IF documents identifiers for different DASH concepts, including profiles, metadata, events and so on at this link https://dashif.org/identifiers/introduction/. For the purpose of keeping the updates up-to-date, we have created a submission form. Please submit your identifiers here: https://bit.ly/dash-identifier-submission.
Once submitted, DASH-IF WG will review the submitted identifiers for consistency and will publish the new identifiers.
