### DASH-IF discusses WebRTC-based Streaming
-- May 28, 2021 - Elbonia, virtual --

On May 28 this year, as part of our virtual special session series, DASH-IF invited the colleagues from Verizon Media and Phenix Real Time Solutions to provide as an overview on a WebRTC-based Premium Streaming Ecosystem.

### Abstract:
WebRTC is the foundational technology for real-time streaming online and as such has widespread support across browsers. It is used widely across many applications.  However, the use of real-time streaming for professionally-produced content is highlighting gaps in WebRTC, creating the need for industry collaboration.  This talk will explore some of these key areas and sketch out possible ways forward for the industry.

### Presenters:
- Bill Wishon is the Chief Product Officer for Phenix Real Time Solutions, leading the company's product strategy and roadmap for real-time video streaming at scale. Bill has 20+ years of experience in the media industry working on business and technology innovation to improve the quality, scale and reliability of online video delivery. Prior to Phenix, Bill held leading technical and product roles at Akamai, Kontiki, VeriSign, LightSurf, and Adobe Systems.
- Ofer Shem Tov is a distinguished video architect in Verizon Media Platform, working on the latest video streaming technologies. Ofer was the development leader for VocalTecâ€™s Internet Phone that started the VoIP revolution in 1995. Ofer later co-founded RayV that developed efficient P2P based video broadcasting and was acquired by Yahoo in 2014.

### Discussion and next steps
We identified the synergies between the approach presented and DASH-based streaming. There was quite some interested to explore more details and DASH-IF will continue the informal discussion. The basic idea is to develop a position paper in DASH-IF together with the colleagues from Verizon Media and Phenix Real Time Solutions and identify if DASH-IF or other organizations can address any of the open issues and coordinate the work.
