1.	Establish a project management system and formal process for the documentation, contributions and code development, testing, metrics, reporting, versioning, and releases;
2.	Develop uniform APIs to improve the development, testing, and server updates of the software;
3.	Refactor of the current software to modularize and improve its performance, 
4.	Repair and maintenance project (Pre-existing bugs are excluded regardless of whether they have already been reported or are reported during the course of the project),
and
5.	Develop documentation of the software
