### DASH-IF announces Public Community Review for Candidate Specification: Watermarking API for Encoder Integration

On December 6th, 2024, DASH-IF published the "[DASH-IF Candidate Specification: Watermarking API for Encoder Integration](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18038517/DASH-IF-CTS-Watermarking-API-v0.9.0.-.Community.Review.pdf)" for community review. 

DASH-IF and UHD Forum have updated the “Watermarking API for encoder integration” to cope with the latest updates on watermarking. The main updates to the document comprise:
- the definition of interfaces to manage watermark pace information and be interoperable with DASH-IF Forensic A/B Watermarking (ETSI TS 104 002)
- the support for multiple processing pipelines to process several ABR representations in a single WMP instance;
- the clarification of ABR segmentation signaling to help the WMP enforcing its watermark pace making logic;
- the explicit signaling of Variant labels to avoid ambiguity in the specification; 
This updated specification is expected to fill the gap with the real needs of the market today.

This is the result of the work in the Content Protection and Security task force in DASH-IF lead by [Laurent Piron](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurentpiron/) from NAGRA and has been done in collaboration between watermarking technology providers (Elemental, Irdeto, Nagravision and Synamedia) and other DASH-IF members. 

The community review is open until January 15th, 2025. Publication is expected by February 26, 2025. Comments may be submitted through the [github](https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/Watermarking/issues).
