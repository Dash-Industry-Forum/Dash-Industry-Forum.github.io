### DASH-IF announces 2nd Community Review: Candidate Technical Specification on _Content Steering for DASH_

On December 21st, 2022, DASH-IF published the DASH-IF Candidate Technical Specification on _Content Steering for DASH_ is available [here](https://dashif.org/guidelines/others#dash-if-candidate-technical-specification-content-steering-for-dash) for a 2nd community review. After receiving excellent feedback from the community for the first review, the spec was updated within DASH-IF. 

<a href="https://dash-industry-forum.github.io/docs/IOP-Guidelines/DASH-IF-CTS-00XX-Content-Steering-2nd-Community-Review-0.9.6.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img height="300px"  src="https://dashif.org/img/content-steering.png" alt="" /></a>

Scope of the specification: Content distributors often use multiple Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to distribute their content to the end-users. They may upload a copy of their catalogue to each CDN, or more commonly have all CDNs pull the content from a common origin. Alternate URLs are generated, one for each CDN, that point at identical content. DASH players may access alternate URLs in the event of delivery problems. Content steering describes a deterministic capability for a content distributor to switch the content source that a player uses either at start-up or midstream, by means of a remote steering service. 

This is the result of the work in the Live and Ad Insertion task force in DASH-IF. The work is led by [Will Law](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wilaw/) from Akamai and is supported by several DASH-IF members: Akamai, Disney Streaming, Comcast, AWS Elemental and Qualcomm. 

This second community review is open until Feb 15th, 2023. Publication is expected by March 31, 2023. Comments may be submitted through the [github](https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/Content-Steering/issues).

This document is a candidate Technical Specification. DASH-IF is expecting to publish this initially, but to submit the specification to a formal specification organization. The primary choice is ETSI, for which DASH-IF has a PAS agreement.
