## DASH-IF publishes a series of updates for next version of IOP Guidelines and for CPIX  

### Background

DASH-IF recently published the following new documents:
* Advanced Ad Insertion in DASH
* DASH events and timed metadata tracks timing and processing model and client reference model
* Audio Amendment to Guidelines for Implementation: DASH-IF Interoperability Points, Version 4.3
* DASH-IF implementation guidelines: content protection and security
* DASH-IF Implementation Guidelines v2.3: Content Protection Information Exchange Format (CPIX)

The former four documents will be rolled into a new version of the DASH-IF IOP guidelines version 5. This work is still in progress and aligned with the MPEG work on the DASH Profile for CMAF content. MPEG is expected to complete the work in November 2020 with issuing the FDIS and DASH-IF v5 is hence expected shortly after.

All documents can be accessed through our <a href="https://dashif.org/guidelines"> public website under the guidelines section</a>. For all documents, feedback can be provided through the respective github trackers.

### Advanced Ad Insertion in DASH

DASH-IF issued a Change request on advanced ad insertion in DASH. Ad Insertion is considered as one of the most important aspects in online video distribution. Also with the development of CMAF, some additional aspects are relevant, such as consistent development of Ad content, content insertion into CMAF live content, etc. This document addresses latest development in the context of Ad Insertion and maps this to DASH, among others:
* Description of most relevant use cases
* Ad Insertion architecture
* Definition of main content requirements and recommendations
* Definition of ad and slate content requirements and recommendations
* Definition of combined main and ad content
* Ad specific metadata
* Ad tracking

This document is technically frozen. However, certain circumstances still may lead to updates of the document. Three main aspects are identified:

The Change Request was developed by the DASH IF Interoperability WG in the Ad Insertion TF led by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zachary-cava-73a99b45/">Zachary Cava</a> (Hulu) and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stockhammer/">Thomas Stockhammer</a> (Qualcomm).

The specification was made possible by the generous contributions and support of member companies: Hulu, Qualcomm, Tencent, Unified Streaming, Akamai, AWS Elemental, Comcast, Lufthansa Systems, Turner, Arris (CommScope), Pearl, Xperi and others.
