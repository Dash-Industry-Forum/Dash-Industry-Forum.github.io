The DASH Industry Forum invites you to an evening of networking during the upcoming IBC show in Amsterdam. We hope to reunite in person with many of you after two years of virtual meetings, online workshops and social draught. During the reception, you will enjoy hors dâ€™oeuvres and an open bar at the Heineken Experience, while mingling with executives, architects and engineers from leading entertainment technology companies.  Entry by registration only. This event sells out quickly so please register early.
