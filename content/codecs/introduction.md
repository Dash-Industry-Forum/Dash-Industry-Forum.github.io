# Introduction

The DASH-IF hosts and manages an online cataloging of codecs for MPEG-DASH that are based on CMAF media profiles:

  1. hosting the online catalog on its website, listing defined media profiles along
     with a short descriptions of relevant DASH MPD parameters,
  2. providing a simple online mechanism to request the addition of new codecs
     and associated information, and finally
  3. managing the administration and maintenance of the online catalog.

It is believed that maintaining such a proper online catalog helps the industry
to increase the interoperability between various industry and consortia
specifications, which are utilizing the MPEG-DASH and CMAF standard.
