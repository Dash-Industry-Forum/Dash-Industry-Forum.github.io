# Introduction

DASH-IF publishes primarily three types of documents:

* Completed Specifications and Guidelines: The documents are stable and have undergone a community and IPR.
* Documents for community review: These documents are technically stable, but public is asked for comments in order to improve details. Community Review documents are published on the DASH-IF website in order to get feedback from the industry on tools and features that are documented for improved interoperability. For each of the documents, comments may be submitted on the technologies itself, on specific features, etc. These documents are only published temporarily for community review and will be replaced by a full version after the commenting period has closed and the comments have been addressed.
* Position and White Papers: These documents provide background and initial studies

With version 5 of DASH-IF Interoperability Guidelines, DASH-IF decided to introduce different parts that each address specific aspects of DASH-based service delivery. Each part is developed and updated within its own timescale.

# Part 6: Content protection and security

## Summary
Part 6 of DASH-IF IOP v5 provides guidelines for encrypted content delivered in MPEG CMAF format protected by MPEG CENC. As MPEG DASH is used as the delivery protocol, this part makes the links between signaling that is within content and within the MPD. In addition, to this, this part describes mechanisms for supporting key rotation. It defines the Enhanced Clear Key Content Protection (ECCP), a content protection mechanism for DASH content which provides greater protection than TLS delivery, token authentication or Clear Key used individually. It also defines the DASH-IF XML schema with elements related to content protection.
