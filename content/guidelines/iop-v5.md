# Introduction

DASH-IF publishes primarily three types of documents:

* Completed Specifications and Guidelines: The documents are stable and have undergone a community and IPR.
* Documents for community review: These documents are technically stable, but public is asked for comments in order to improve details.
* Position and White Papers: These documents provide background and initial studies

With version 5 of DASH-IF Interoperability Guidelines, DASH-IF decided to introduce different parts that each address specific aspects of DASH-based service delivery. Each part is developed and updated within its own timescale.
