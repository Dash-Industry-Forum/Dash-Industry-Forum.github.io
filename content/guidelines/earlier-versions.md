## DASH-IF Interoperability Points and Extensions

### Scope

The scope of the DASH-IF InterOperability Points (IOPs) defined in this document is to provide support for high-quality video distribution for over the top services using H.264/AVC and H.265/HEVC. Both live and on-demand services are supported. The specified features enable relevant use cases including on-demand, live services, ad insertion, trick modes, seek preview, content protection and subtitling. Extensions for multi-channel audio and next generation audio with different codecs as well as extensions to video different codecs and Ultra High Definition are defined.

Any identified bugs or missing features may be submitted through the DASH-IF issue tracker at https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/DASH-IF-IOP/issues.

Note that version 4.3 is published as an add on to v4.2, but with the next version it is expected that a either a multipart version or a restructured version will be generated, with a major editorial updates. The new version is expected to be available by spring of 2020.

## DASH-IF Content Protection Information Exchange Format

### Scope

The scope of this document is to define a Content Protection Information Exchange Format (CPIX). The CPIX document contains keys and DRM information used for encrypting and protecting content, and can be used for exchanging this information among entities needing it in many possibly different workflows for preparing, for example DASH content or HLS content. The CPIX document itself can be encrypted, signed and authenticated so that its receivers can be sure that its confidentiality, source and integrity are also protected.

## DASH-IF Implementation Guidelines: Token-based Access Control for DASH (TAC)

### Scope

The scope of this document is to define a token-based access control mechanism and to enable the signaling of Authentication and Authorization (AA) protocols for DASH-based streaming. An Access Token is a proof that a DASH client or user of the client have been successfully authenticated and authorized in some pre-determined AA Systems to access a particular DASH resource, e.g. DASH segments or MPDs.
This document defines an Access Token format for accessing DASH resources and its transport between a DASH client and a server, hence ensuring interoperability between content providers and content delivery networks. The document focuses on the signaling and exchange mechanisms to facilitate Access Token-protected requests for the delivery of MPDs, licenses, keys and segments. This document can be used in addition to the general DASH-IF Interoperability Points.

Comments and bugs may be submitted through the [public github repository](https://gitreports.com/issue/Dash-Industry-Forum/TAC)

## DASH-IF Technical Specification: Live Media Ingest

### Scope

This document presents the DASH-IF Live Media Ingest Protocol Specification. Two protocol interfaces are defined. The first, interface 1, CMAF ingest, is based on fragmented MPEG-4 as defined in the common media application track format (CMAF). The second interface is based on MPEG DASH and HLS as defined by ISO SC29 WG 11 and IETF. Both Interfaces use the HTTP POST Method to transmit media objects from the ingest source to the receiving entity. Examples of live streaming workflows using these protocol interfaces are also presented. The protocol interfaces also support carriage of timed metadata and timed text. Guidelines for redundancy and failover are also included.

### Latest Version

[DASH-IF Live Media Ingest Protocol v1.0] (https://dashif-documents.azurewebsites.net/Ingest/master/DASH-IF-Ingest.html) ([pdf](https://dashif-documents.azurewebsites.net/Ingest/master/DASH-IF-Ingest.pdf)) | [License declarations](https://dashif.org/ipr-declarations/)

# DASH-IF Interoperability Documents for Community Review

## General

Community Review documents are published on the DASH-IF website in order to
get feedback from the industry on tools and features that are documented for
improved interoperability. For each of the documents, comments may be
submitted on the technologies itself, on specific features, etc. These
documents are only published temporarily for community review and will be
replaced by a full version after the commenting period has closed and the
comments have been addressed.

## DASH-IF Technical Specification: Audio Update

* A revision for community review for the Live Media Ingest specification is provided here: [Audio Amendment to Guidelines for Implementation: DASH-IF Interoperability Points, Version 4.3, rev1.1 (clean)](https://dash-industry-forum.github.io/docs/Audio%20Amendment%20to%20DASH%20IOP%204.3%20-%201.1-cl.pdf) [(revision mark)](https://dash-industry-forum.github.io/docs/Audio%20Amendment%20to%20DASH%20IOP%204.3%20-%201.1.pdf) 
* Community review is open until June 30th, 2021. Publication is expected by August 31, 2021.
* Comments may be submitted through the [github](https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/Audio/issues)

## DASH-IF Technical Specification: Live Media Ingest version 2

* A revision for community review for the Live Media Ingest specification is provided 
  [here (html)](https://dashif-documents.azurewebsites.net/Ingest/pull/143/DASH-IF-Ingest.html)
* Two closely related protocol interfaces are defined: CMAF Ingest (Interface-1) based on fragmented MP4 and DASH/HLS Ingest (Interface-2) based on DASH and HLS. Both interfaces use the HTTP POST (or PUT) method to transmit media objects from an ingest source to a receiving entity. These interfaces support carriage of audiovisual media, timed metadata and timed text. Examples of workflows using these interfaces are provided. In addition, guidelines for synchronization of multiple ingest sources, redundancy and failover are presented.
* Community review is open until May 31st, 2021. Publication is expected by August 31, 2021.
* Comments may be submitted through the [github](https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/Ingest/issues).

## Updated Timing Model for v5

* The change request against IOP v4.3 for Community Review is accessible 
  [here (pdf)](https://dashif-documents.azurewebsites.net/Guidelines-TimingModel/master/Guidelines-TimingModel.pdf) and [here (html)]( https://dashif-documents.azurewebsites.net/Guidelines-TimingModel/master/Guidelines-TimingModel.html)
* The purpose of this chapter is to give a holistic overview of DASH presentation timing and related segment addressing. It is not intended to provide details of the timing model and all possible uses of the attributes in MPEG-DASH. In order to achieve higher interoperability, DASH-IF’s Implementation Guidelines allow considerably limited options than the ones provided by MPEG-DASH, constraining services to a specific set of reasonably flexible behaviors that are highly interoperable with modern client platforms. This chapter covers the timing model and related segment addressing schemes for these common use-cases.
* Please note: this Community Review is only limited to Chapter 5 of the Interoperability Guidelines, which includes the revised Timing model constraints and other interoperability constraints.  Community Review for the other portions of the Interoperability Guidelines will be available at a future time.
* Community review is open until November 30th, 2019. Addition to IOP is expected by Q1/2020.
* Comments may be submitted through the [github](https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/Guidelines-TimingModel/issues/new?labels=community-review).

## WebIDL DASH Event Metadata API 

* The change request against IOP v4.3 for Community Review is accessible
  [here](https://dash-industry-forum.github.io/docs/Event API-WebIDL-r1.htm) and a [pdf version](https://dash-industry-forum.github.io/docs/Event API-WebIDL-CR.pdf).
* This document specifies an API that a user agent or DASH client can expose for application access to DASH events. This builds upon Media Source Extensions. The API correspond to partial interfaces with respect to the DASHEvent event target. It is meant to cover both in-band ('emsg') and MPD-carriage of events, as well as sparse timed metadata tracks.
* Community review is open until August 31st, 2019. Addition to IOP is expected by Q1/2020.
* Comments may be submitted through the [github](https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/Events/issues/new?labels=community-review) adding label "Community-Review" or [public bugtracker](https://gitreports.com/issue/Dash-Industry-Forum/Events)
