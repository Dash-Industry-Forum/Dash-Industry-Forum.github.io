      <description>DASH-IF Publishes Live Media Ingest Technical Specification With 18 months of collaborative work, the DASH-IF published a technical specification on live media ingest. While DASH is excellent for streaming to clients, transmitting content from a live source to an origin or packager benefits from a different approach. The live media ingest specification provides this and defines a protocol to ingest DASH and CMAF content using the HTTP POST method. The specification can be used in streaming workflows that combine live sources, such as encoders, with recipient servers.</description>
